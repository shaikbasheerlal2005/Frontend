<h3>HTML</h3>
<p> HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages. It's a markup language, not a programming language, and it provides the structure and layout of a webpage. HTML uses a series of elements, defined by tags, to tell web browsers how to display content like text, images, and links.</p>
