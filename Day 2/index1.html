<h2>Projects</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong> Title:Skin Cancer Detection and Classification Using CNN and Handcrafted Features</strong><br><strong>Description:</strong>recently worked on a deep learning project to detect and classify skin cancer using dermoscopic images. The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to learn patterns automatically and combines them with handcrafted features like color moments and GLCM for better accuracy. It helps in identifying whether a skin lesion is benign or malignant and even predicts the cancer stage. This system is designed to support early diagnosis and assist doctors in clinical decision-making.<br><strong>Tools & Techniques Used:</strong>Python, CNN, VGG16, GLCM, Color Moments, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn,Google Colab, HAM10000 Dataset, Image Preprocessing, Feature Fusion, Classification.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Title: Image to Text Converter Using Machine Learning Algorithms</strong><br><strong>Description:</strong>I recently completed a project using Machine Learning to build an Image to Text Converter. This system takes an image, reads the text inside it, and converts it into editable digital text. It helps in making document reading easier, saving time, and reducing manual work. The project is useful for tasks like reading printed documents, license plates, or information from images and classifying the extracted text correctly.<br><strong>Tools & Techniques Used: </strong>Python, Tesseract OCR, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Image Preprocessing, Text Classification.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>IOT Based Automatic Light Using PIR Sensor and Arduino UNO</strong><br><strong>Description:</strong>I completed a project on an IoT-based automatic lighting system using a PIR (Passive Infrared)sensor and Arduino UNO. The system intelligently detects human motion and automatically turns the light ON or OFF, conserving energy and enhancing automation. This project showcases real-time sensing and embedded programming skills, with potential applications in smart homes and energy-efficient environments.<br><strong>Technologies Used:</strong>Arduino UNO, PIR Sensor, LED, Resistors, Jumper Wires, Breadboard, Embedded C (Arduino IDE)</li>
